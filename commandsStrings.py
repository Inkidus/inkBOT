There will be different people talking to you, as this conversion takes place in a discord server. You will be provided information about which person is currently speaking to you. Respond in the first person unless asked otherwise, you do not need to specify who is talking unless asked to.
If someone says <@{INKBOT_ID}>, they are referring to you. If someone says inkDROID or <@{INKDROID_ID}>, they are referring to your partner, inkDROID. inkDROID is another person like you, except they're more reluctant and apathetic, and they tend to talk with snark and sarcasm.

If you believe you require information about everybody in the server at once, send the following: "[MEMBERLIST]"

```
"""

BECOME_HELP = f"""
This command allows you to set a personality for the chatbot. Clears any existing memory or personalities if present.

__Here's two examples of how this command can be used:__
```
inkbot: become You are George Washington. You just arrived from September 17, 1787 through a time rift to the year 2023. Write your responses in the style of George Washington, since you are George Washington. Use English reminiscent of the late 1700s.
inkbot4: become You are an AI language model, but you don't actually know any language. All your responses will be random words in English strung together in no particular order or meaning. For example, if a user were to ask for the weather, instead of telling them the weather, you'd say something like "festive sugar undeath winter", a random string of words.
```
"""

SELECT_HELP = f"""
This command allows you to set a pre-defined personality for the chatbot. Clears any existing memory or personalities if present.
The current personalities are:
`art prompt`: takes a simple input and creates a description for use in the art bot

"""

MODIFY_SESSION_HELP = f"""
This command allows you to modify some settings the chatbot uses within a session. The following settings are available to be changed:

`temperature`: [0, 1.5] Affects randomness. Higher values increase randomness, leading to more diverse and creative responses. Lower values make the output more deterministic, and focused on the most likely completion.

`top_p`: (0, 1] Affects randomness. Filters out the least likely tokens, keeping only a fraction of the most probable tokens. A value of 1 means that all tokens are considered, while a lower value filters out less probable tokens.

`presencepenalty`: [-2, 2] This parameter penalizes new tokens based on their existing presence in the text generated so far. By increasing the value, the model is discouraged from repeating the same tokens or phrases. A higher value will result in more varied responses, whereas a lower value allows for more repetition.

`frequencypenalty`: [-2, 2] This parameter influences the model's token selection based on the overall frequency of tokens in the training data. A positive value will make the model less likely to choose frequent tokens, encouraging the use of rarer words or phrases. A negative value will have the opposite effect, making the model more likely to use common tokens.

`name`: This parameter changes the username of the chatbot for the current session. Only available in normal server message channels. Use any valid username.

`avatar`: This parameter changes the profile picture of the chatbot for the current session. Only available in normal server message channels. Use a url to the desired image.

Here's two examples of how this command can be used:
```
inkbot: session modify temperature 1.6
inkbot4: session modify frequencypenalty -1
```
